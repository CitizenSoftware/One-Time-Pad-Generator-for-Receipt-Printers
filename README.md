This is meant to simplify the process of both understanding, making, and using OTPs. 

There is no reason for things to be so complicated to I made it print 2 copies per key automatically as well as the message worksheets.

I made it use mod 10 (meaning you always use the last digit and do not carry tens digits) which simplifies significantly. 

The choice to use numbers instead of letters as the key code is for that mod 10 reason. 

You get each perforated by the receipt printer because of automated sizing. 

I will proof this against user error as I test it further.

It is as simple as it gets.
